# My Agent

I’m building an interactive DSA learning web app with a refined black & white cosmic theme. Produce a cohesive visual design system (CSS+tailwind tokens, micro-interactions, and sample components) that ensures high contrast, readability, and elegant cosmic aesthetics. Requirements:

Color tokens: exact hex values for deep space black, layered dark grays, pure white text, muted whites for UI, soft silver accents, and a subtle blue glow for highlights. Provide 6–8 token names and usage guidance (bg, card, text, subtle, accent, glow).

Starfield: give a performant canvas or r3f implementation with multi-layer parallax, occasional shooting stars, and a nebula gradient overlay; include device-adaptive settings (low/medium/high).

Card design (frosted glass): exact CSS for backdrop-blur, border, inner shadow, neon border pulse animation, accessible contrast, and fallback for reduced-motion. Provide example classes and Tailwind utilities.

Typography & spacing: recommended font stack, sizes for headings/body/code, and line-heights for accessibility. Include a fluid type scale for responsive headings.

Micro-interactions: precise framer-motion variants for page transitions, hover, focus, click ripple, and floating/levitation. Include code snippets for each variant.

Code panel: monochrome syntax highlighting theme (light-white on dark), with focused line highlight styles that are easily visible against the frost card. Provide a highlight.js theme config or CSS tokens.

Contrast & accessibility: ensure all token combinations meet WCAG AA; provide adjustments for high-contrast toggle and color-blind safe options.

Deliverables: a single tailwind plugin file (cosmic-theme.js) + 4 sample component files (Card, Navbar, Starfield, CodePanel) with full CSS/TSX. Prioritize clarity, minimalism, and a portfolio-grade visual polish.

Output: complete code snippets ready to drop into a Next.js + Tailwind project and a short example showing the theme applied to an ArrayVisualizer component.
